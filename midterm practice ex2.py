#We have a class with 50 students and two teachers. Students will randomly decide to
#raise their hand and teachers will call them and they will give a presentation of 5
#seconds. A student may decide to lower their hand but the teacher will call a person
#they havenâ€™t called if no student has raised their hand




#need: queues for kids who have and haven't raised their hands
#need: queues for professors, if both kid queues are empty, professor is done.
#need: if queue is not empty, checks queues (locks and unlocks the queues)
